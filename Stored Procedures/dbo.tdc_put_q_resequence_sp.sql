/**************************************************************************
tdc_put_q_resequence_sp - This stored procedure is used to relocate a task
on the queue to a different sequence within a priority. Both sequences must 
exist on the same priority. The resequencing could be in any direction (i.e.
a task could be moved to a higher or lower sequence.
Parameters:
    @iMoveFromSeqNo - sequence of task to move
    @iMoveToSeqNo - target sequence
    @iPriority - task's priority
